# ECE444-F2021-Lab6

## Part 1: Tutorial
The activity was to replay [mjhea0/flaskr-tdd](https://github.com/mjhea0/flaskr-tdd).

This is completed in this repository. [gabriellemadden/ECE444-F2021-Lab6](https://github.com/gabriellemadden/ECE444-F2021-Lab6)

## Part 2: Test Cases
The activity was to add test cases to the group project. The tests I wrote can be found [here](https://github.com/ECE444-2021Fall/project1-education-pathways-group-16-4b1z/blob/bcd9131adf820c2a6d172d9668382c519dbee4a9/test/test_course_search.py#L19-L39)

## Part 3: TDD Evaaluation
Weighing the value of TDD:

| Pros | Cons |
| - | - |
| -> It makes the goal of functions/classes you are writing much clearer | -> you may not have clear goals to test when you start writing |
| -> tests are already written before code, so you don't have to go back and write tests at the end | -> enforces a required code structure before code is written. If during code writing, it is found that the structure must be changed, tests may also have to be rewritten  |
| -> ensures all of your base cases are covered and passing once code is written | -> more time consuming, so not ideal if a feature or bug fix is time-sensitive |
| -> catches programming errors/bugs earlier in the process to avoid having to do large refactors/debugging later | |
